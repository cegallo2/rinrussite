# (User interation needed) After get a raw pdb file (raw.pdb), check ambiguous atoms, clean up
# (Automated) Run reduce, generate a new H added pdb file (raw_h.pdb) 
# (Can be automated) Check the new pdb file, if there is metal, replace with an atom with same coordination (such as replace Mg with O)
# (UIN) Check all ligands, make sure H atoms were added correctly (may need to delete or add more H based on certain condition)
# (Can be automated) If there is atom "CA" or "CB" in ligands, replace with "CA'" and "CB'"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
START HERE	

# After previous 3 check stpes, save the file to a new file (raw_h_modify.pdb)
# Use this new pdb file (raw_h_modify.pdb), run probe and save result to *.probe
# Run probe2rins.py
# (Can be skipped for now) Modify freq_per_res.dat file for trim residues
# (Needs to modify for user input) Use raw_h.pdb, freq_per_res.dat, and other needed files run probe_freq_2pdb.py
# Run pymol_scripts.py to add H to the trimmed pdb files for differnt size model

IN THE END: 



Add way to display PDB information to site
INSTALL PYMOL

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALGORITHM:

To run probe:
chmod u+x probe
./probe 3bwm_h_mg_ts_wGlu199.ent > filename.probe

To run probe2rins.py:
python probe2rins.py filename.probe A:300,A:301,A:302		(Chain:Residue),
This creates 3 files

Probe_freq_2pdb.py:
Needs user input
Creates a ton of files

Pymol_scripts.py:
Run for each of the generated files
python pymol_scripts.py filename.pdb 301,302				(Residues)

Run Pymol: 
(just once) pymol -qc log.pml		

Final Step:
Zip up all of the files from last two steps and make downloadable
